This project is a first iteration on a custom made gpx exporter for the next Bixi season
I intend to be able to store the data I'll generate in gpx files, using extensions to add data specific to this project

It is based on the code of open-gps-tracker http://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker/ and some part of citybikes
https://github.com/eskerda/CityBikes http://www.citybik.es

To be able to run, or maybe even compile, you'll have to move the   DUMMYdonottranslate_private.xml file from
res/values-v1 to res/values, renaming it private.xml and filling it with your own keys.

Also, you have to input your Google map API key in the layout/map.xml file that matches your signing certificate
